        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Handong Harvest!<br><br>
            We are the Handong Harvest team, and we created this platform to make buying, selling, and sharing goods and
            services easier, safer, and more convenient for our university community. Harvest is exclusively for
            Handong-related individuals—students, staff, and faculty—so every interaction happens within a trusted
            circle. This means exchanges are not only simple and nearby but also safe, as you're always dealing with
            fellow Handon members.<br><br>
            Our idea grew from the challenges many students, especially international ones, face when navigating
            marketplaces outside of the university. Language barriers, cultural differences, and unfamiliar systems
            often make it hard to connect and find what you need. Harvest bridges that gap, offering a space where both
            Korean and international students can connect in English and Korean, share resources, and support one
            another.<br><br>
            True to the spirit of Handong University and our Honor Code, Harvest is built on trust, honesty, and
            integrity. Whether you're looking to sell a textbook, offer tutoring services, or give away something for
            free, Harvest ensures a safe and respectful environment for all.<br><br>
            The name Harvest reflects our goal: a place where you can gather what you need, share what you have, and
            grow together as a community. Whether you're earning money, saving on essentials, or connecting with others,
            Harvest is here to make your Handong experience even more exciting.<br><br>
            Let's harvest together!
